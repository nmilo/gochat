# GoChat - p2p chat

GoChat is terminal-based p2p chat application using UDP hole punching.

![Demo](/demo.gif "Demo")

## Features

### P2P communication over UDP protocol

Direct peer to peer communication over UDP protocol. UDP connection is established by of use UDP hole punching.

### E2E encryption

Messages between peers are encrypted end to end. Using AES encryption and Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange.

### Communication channels (rooms)

Clients can communicate over any different channels aka rooms. Clients can join rooms by specifing room identifier, defined by arbitrary string.

### Peer discovery and connection management

Rendezvous server keeps list of all active peers on network, grouped by channels.
Liveness of node is kept using Heartbeat mechanism. Clients periodically send a heartbeat to rendezvous server updating timestamp of their last hearbeat.

Server checks for state of last heartbeat and removes nodes that were not active in last 15 seconds.

Once a new client connects its added the table of active peers and its pressence is announced to all other existing active peers on network. Same applies for disconnects.


### Gracefull disconnects

Clients can handle gracefull disconnects notifiying bootnode of peer disconnection from p2p network. Bootnode removes peer from the list of active peers and relays that information to all active peers on network.

## Usage

Compile binary using makefile

```
make
```

Start a bootnode (aka. rendezvous server) on a publicly acccessible server.

```
./gochat --mode bootnode --listen 0.0.0.0:4321
```

Start client A from a machine behind supported NAT
```
go run main.go --mode client --bootnode <ip_of_bootnode_server>:4321 --room test1
```

Start client B on a different network with supported NAT
```
go run main.go --mode client --bootnode <ip_of_bootnode_server>:4321 --room test1
```

Both clients should register with the bootnode server and establish direct UDP connection.
Subsequent communication between peers is possible without bootnode server.

## Supported NATs

- Full Cone NAT
- Restricted Cone NAT
- Port Restricted Cone NAT

Symmetric NATs are **not supported** due to dynamic IP address/port pairs for outgoing connections.
